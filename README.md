# CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions üöÄ

This project demonstrates the setup and usage of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Node.js application. The pipeline automates testing, building, and deploying an application to AWS ECS.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Automated Testing**: Runs tests automatically on every push to the main branch.
- **Seamless Deployment**: Deploys the application to AWS ECS with zero downtime.
- **Image Management**: Manages and pushes the built image to AWS ECR for efficient versioning and reuse.
- **Monitoring**: Integrates with GitHub Actions' built-in workflow monitoring for transparency and control.
- **Scalability**: Deploys on ECS, allowing automatic scaling and management of containers.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD workflow.
- **AWS ECS**: Hosts and manages the deployed application.
- **AWS ECR**: Stores Docker container images.
- **Node.js**: Back-end application runtime environment.

## Project Structure üìÅ
- `.github/workflows`: Contains the GitHub Actions workflow files.
- `app.js`: Main application file.
- `test.js`: Contains tests for the application.

## Benefits üåü
- **Continuous Integration**: Ensures the application is tested for functionality with every change.
- **Continuous Delivery**: Automatically builds and deploys the application after successful tests.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Uses ECS to manage containerized applications efficiently.
- **Version Control**: Tracks changes through GitHub Actions and maintains version history of deployments.

## Workflow Overview üîÑ
1. **Push to Main Branch**: Triggers the workflow on every commit pushed to the main branch.
2. **Run Tests**: Executes unit tests to ensure the application functions as expected.
3. **Build Application**: Prepares the application for deployment if tests pass.
4. **Push Image to ECR**: Uploads the application image to AWS ECR.
5. **Deploy to ECS**: Deploys the latest image to AWS ECS with automated scaling and load balancing.

## Setup Instructions üìù

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ
- AWS account with the necessary IAM permissions for ECR and ECS.
- Node.js environment set up locally.
- Existing ECS cluster and task definitions configured in AWS.

### Configuration Steps ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Configure AWS Credentials**:
   Set up your AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets to allow GitHub Actions to access your AWS account.

2. **Modify Workflow Configuration**:
   Update the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with your AWS region, ECR repository URL, and ECS service details.

3. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
   Commit and push your changes to the main branch. This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.

4. **Monitor Workflow**:
   Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the workflow execution.

5. **Check Deployment**:
   Once the workflow completes, verify that your application has been successfully deployed to AWS ECS by checking the ECS service logs or accessing your application through its public URL.

## Conclusion üéâ
This project provides a robust, automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for your Node.js application. With the integration of AWS services like ECS and ECR, it ensures a smooth deployment process that scales easily with your application needs. By automating tests, builds, and deployments, you can focus on writing code and let the pipeline handle the heavy lifting of delivering your updates to production.

## Future Improvements üîß
- **Integration with CloudWatch**: For advanced logging and monitoring of deployed services.
- **Automated Rollback**: Implement rollback strategies in case of failed deployments.
- **Support for Multi-Region Deployments**: Expand deployment to multiple regions for better reliability and availability.
